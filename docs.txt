The British ordered the Acadians expelled from their lands in 1755 during the French and Indian War; an event called the Expulsion of the Acadians or le Grand Derangement [89] The "expulsion" resulted in approximately 12,000 Acadians being shipped to destinations throughout Britain's North America and to France; Quebec and the French Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue [90] The first wave of the expulsion of the Acadians began with the Bay of Fundy Campaign (1755) and the second wave began after the final Siege of Louisbourg (1758). Many of the Acadians settled in southern Louisiana, creating the Cajun culture there [91] Some Acadians managed to hide and others eventually returned to Nova Scotia, but they were far outnumbered by a new migration of New England Planters who were settled on the former lands of the Acadians and transformed Nova Scotia from a colony of occupation for the British to a settled colony with stronger ties to New England [91] Britain eventually gained control of Quebec City and Montreal after the Battle of the Plains of Abraham and Battle of Fort Niagara in 1759,and the Battle of the Thousand Islands and Battle of Sainte-Foy in 1760.[92]

Amongst notable Metis people are television actor Tom Jackson [98] Commissioner of the Northwest Territories Tony Whitford, and Louis Riel who led two resistance movements: the Red River Rebellion of 1869-1870 and the North- West Rebellion of 1885, which ended in his trial. [99][1OO][1o1]
The languages inherently Metis are either Metis French or a mixed language called Michif. Michif; Mechif or Metchif is a phonetic spelling of Metif, a variant of Metis [102] The Metis today predominantly speak English; with French a strong second language, as well as numerous Aboriginal tongues. A 19th-century community of the Metis people, the Anglo-Metis, were referred to as Countryborn: They were children of Rupert's Land fur trade typically of Orcadian, Scottish, or English paternal descent and Aboriginal maternal descent [103] Their first languages would have been Aboriginal (Cree, Saulteaux, Assiniboine, etc ) and English: Their fathers spoke Gaelic, thus leading to the development of an English dialect referred to as "Bungee" [104]
S.35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 mentions the Metis yet there has long been debate over legally defining the term Metis, [105] but on September 23,2003,the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Metis are a distinct people with significant rights (Powley ruling) [106]

The Metis are people descended from marriages between Europeans (mainly French) [95] and Cree, Ojibway; Algonquin, Saulteaux, Menominee; Mikmaq, Maliseet, and other First Nations [14] Their history dates to the mid-17th century [3] When Europeans first arrived to Canada they relied on Aboriginal peoples for fur trading skills and survival. To ensure alliances, relationships between European fur traders and Aboriginal women were often consolidated through marriage [96] The Metis homeland consists of the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec; New Brunswick; Nova Scotia, and Ontario, as well as the Northwest Territories (NWT) [97]

Warfare was common among Inuit groups with sufficient population density: Inuit, such as the Nunatamiut (Uummarmiut) who inhabited the Mackenzie River delta area, often engaged in common warfare. The Central Arctic Inuit lacked the population density to engage in warfare: In the 13th century; the Thule culture began arriving in Greenland from what is now Canada. Norse accounts are scant: Norse-made items from Inuit campsites in Greenland were obtained by either trade or plunder [87] One account, Ivar Bardarson;, speaks of "small people" with whom the Norsemen fought [88] 14th-century accounts that a western settlement, one of the two Norse settlements, was taken over by the Skraeling [89]
After the disappearance of the Norse colonies in Greenland, the Inuit had no contact with Europeans for at least a century: By the mid- 16th century; Basque fishers were already working the Labrador coast and had established whaling stations on land, such as been excavated at Red Bay:  [90] The Inuit appear not to have interfered with their operations; but they did raid the stations in winter for tools, and particularly worked Iron, which they adapted to native needs [91]

The Inuit are the descendants of what anthropologists call the Thule culture, which emerged from western Alaska around 1,000 CE and spread eastward across the Arctic, displacing the Dorset culture (in Inuktitut; the Tuniit) Inuit historically referred to the Tuniit as "giants or "dwarfs' who were taller and stronger than the Inuit [85] Researchers hypothesize that the Dorset culture lacked dogs, larger weapons and other technologies used by the expanding Inuit society [86] By 1300,the Inuit had settled in west Greenland, and finally moved into east Greenland over the following century: The Inuit had trade routes with more southern cultures Boundary disputes were common and led to led to aggressive actions [15] TECH

Many Aboriginal civilizations[76] established characteristics and hallmarks that included permanent urban settlements or cities [77] agriculture; civic and monumental architecture, and complex societal hierarchies [78] These cultures had evolved and changed by the time of the first permanent European arrivals (c. late 1Sth-early I6th centuries), and have been brought forward through archaeological investigations [79]
There are indications of contact made before Christopher Columbus between the first peoples and those from other continents. Aboriginal people in Canada interacted with Europeans around 1000 CE, but prolonged contact came after Europeans established permanent settlements in the 17th and 18th centuries [80] European written accounts generally recorded friendliness of the First Nations, who profited in trade with Europeans [80] Such trade generally strengthened the more organized political entities such as the Iroquois Confederation [81] Throughout the 16th century; European fleets made almost annual visits to the eastern shores of Canada to cultivate the fishing opportunities A sideline industry emerged in the un-organized traffic of furs overseen by the Indian Department [82]

The Woodland cultural period dates from about 2,000 BCE-1,000 CE, and has locales in Ontario, Quebec, and Maritime regions [71] The introduction of pottery distinguishes the Woodland culture from the earlier Archaic stage inhabitants: Laurentian people of southern Ontario manufactured the oldest pottery excavated to date in Canada [60] They created pointed-bottom beakers decorated by a cord marking technique that involved impressing tooth implements into wet clay: Woodland technology included items such as beaver incisor knives, bangles, and chisels. The population practising sedentary agricultural life ways continued to increase on a diet of squash, corn, and bean crops [60] RESOURCE TECH The Hopewell tradition is an Aboriginal culture that flourished along American rivers from 300 BCE-5O0 CE. At its greatest extent; the Hopewell Exchange System networked cultures and societies with the peoples on the Canadian shores of Lake Ontario. Canadian expression of the Hopewellian peoples encompasses the Point Peninsula, Saugeen, and Laurel complexes [72][73][74]

The west coast of Canada by 7,000-5000 BCE (9,000-7,000 years ag0) saw various cultures who organized themselves around salmon fishing [65] The Nuu-chah-nulth of Vancouver Island began whaling with advanced long spears at about this time [65] The Maritime Archaic is one group of North America's Archaic culture of sea-mammal hunters In the subarctic. They prospered from approximately 7,000 BCE-1,500 BCE (9,000-3,500 years ag0) along the Atlantic Coast of North America [66] Thelr settlements included Ionghouses and boat-topped temporary or seasonal houses. They engaged in Iong-< distance trade, using as currency white chert; a rock quarried from northern Labrador to Maine [67] The Pre-Columbian culture, whose members were called Red Paint People, is indigenous to the New England and Atlantic Canada regions of North America: The culture flourished between 3,000 BCE-1,000 BCE (5,000-3,000 years ago) and was named after their burial ceremonies, which used large quantities of red ochre to cover bodies and grave goods [68]

The placement of artifacts and materials within an Archaic burial site indicated social differentiation based upon status [58] There is a continuous record of occupation of Solh Temexw by Aboriginal people dating from the early Holocene period, 10,000-9,000 years ago. [62] Archaeological sites at Stave Lake; Coquitlam Lake, Fort Langley and region uncovered early period artifacts. These early inhabitants were highly mobile hunter-gatherers, consisting of about 20 to 50 members of an extended family [62][verification needed] The Na-Dene people occupied much of the land area of northwest and central North America starting around 8,000 BCE [63] They were the earliest ancestors of the Athabaskan-speaking peoples, including the Navajo and Apache. They had villages with large multi-family dwellings, used seasonally during the summer; from which they hunted, fished and gathered food supplies for the winter [64] The Wendat peoples settled into Southern Ontario along the Eramosa River around 8,000-7,000 BCE (10,000-9,000 years ago) [65] They were concentrated between Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay: Wendat hunted caribou to survive on the glacier-covered land. [65] Many different First Nations cultures relied upon the buffalo starting by 6,000-5,000 BCE (8,000-7,000 years ago) [65] They hunted buffalo by herding migrating buffalo off cliffs. Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, near Lethbridge; Alberta, is a hunting grounds that was in use for about 5,000 years [65]

The Arctic small tool tradition is a broad cultural entity that developed along the Alaska Peninsula; around Bristol Bay, and on the eastern shores of the Bering Strait around 2,500 BCE (4,500 years ag0) [69] These Paleo-Arctic peoples had a highly distinctive toolkit of small blades (microblades) that were pointed at both ends and used as side- or end-barbs on arrows or spears made of other materials, such as bone or antler Scrapers, engraving tools and adze blades were also included in their toolkits [69] The Arctic small tool tradition branches off into TOD two cultural variants, including the Pre-Dorset; and the Independence traditions. These two groups, ancestors of Thule people; were displaced by the Inuit by 1000 Common Era (CE) [69]:179-81

The Plano cultures was a group of hunter- gatherer communities that occupied the Great Plains area of North America between 12,000 - 10,000 years ago [56] The Paleo-Indians moved into new territory as it emerged from under the glaciers. Big game flourished in this new environment [57] The Plano culture are characterized by a range of projectile point tools collectively called Plano points, which were used to hunt bison; Their diets also included pronghorn, elk, deer; raccoon and coyote [56] At the beginning of the Archaic Era; they began to adopt a sedentary approach to subsistence [56] Sites in and around Belmont; Nova Scotia have evidence of Plano-Indians, indicating small seasonal hunting camps, perhaps re-visited over generations from around 11,000-10,000 years ago [56] Seasonal large and smaller game fish and fowl were food and raw material sources: Adaptation to the harsh environment included tailored clothing and skin-covered tents on wooden frames [56]

The first inhabitants of North America arrived in Canada at least 15,000 years ag0,though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival [40] It is believed the inhabitants entered the Americas pursuing Pleistocene mammals such as the giant beaver; steppe wisent, musk ox, mastodons; woolly mammoths and ancient reindeer (early caribou) [41] One route hypothesized is that people walked south by way of an ice-free corridor on the east side of the Rocky Mountains, and then fanned out across North America before continuing on to South America [42] The other conjectured route is that they migrated, either on foot or using primitive boats, down the Pacific Coast to the tip of South America, and then crossed the Rockies and Andes [43] Evidence of the latter has been covered by a sea level rise of hundreds of metres following the last ice age [44][45]
The Old Crow Flats and basin was one of the areas In Canada untouched by glaciations during the Pleistocene Ice ages,thus it served as a pathway and refuge for ice age plants and animals [46] The area holds evidence of early human habitation in Canada dating from about 12,000.[47] Fossils from the area include some never accounted for In North America, such as hyenas and large camels [48] Bluefish Caves is an archaeological site in Yukon; Canada from which a specimen of apparently human-worked mammoth bone has been radiocarbon dated to 12,000 years ago [47]

According to archaeological and genetic evidence; North and South America Were the last continents in the world with human habitation [27] During the Wisconsin glaciation, 50,000-17,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move across the Bering land bridge that joined Siberia to north west North America (Alaska) [28] Alaska was ice-free because of Iow snowfall, allowing a small population to exist. The Laurentide ice sheet covered most of Canada; blocking nomadic inhabitants and confining them to Alaska (East Beringia) for thousands of years [29][30] Aboriginal genetic studies suggest that the first inhabitants of the Americas share a single ancestral population; one that developed in isolation; conjectured to be Beringia [31][32][33] The isolation of these peoples in Beringia might have lasted 10,000-20,000 years [34][35][36] Around 16,500 years ago, the glaciers began melting, allowing people to move south and east into Canada and beyond [37][38][39]

The term Eskimo has pejorative connotations in Canada and Greenland. Indigenous peoples in those areas have replaced the term Eskimo with Inuit [23][24] The Yupik of Alaska and Siberia do not consider themselves Inuit; and ethnographers agree they are a distinct people: [8J[24] They prefer the terminology Yupik; Yupiit; or Eskimo. The Yupik languages are linguistically distinct from the Inuit languages [8] Linguistic groups of Arctic people have no universal replacement term for Eskimo, inclusive of all Inuit and Yupik people across the geographical area inhabited by the Inuit and Yupik peoples [8]

Besides these ethnic descriptors, Aboriginal peoples are often divided into legal categories based on their relationship with the Crown (i.e the state). Section 91 (clause 24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 gives the federal government (as opposed to the provinces) the sole responsibility for "Indians; and Lands reserved for the Indians' The government inherited treaty obligations from the British colonial authorities in Eastern Canada and signed treaties itself with First Nations in Western Canada (the Numbered Treaties)  It also passed the Indian Act in 1876 which governed its interactions with all treaty and non- treaty peoples. Members of First Nations bands that are subject to the Indian Act with the Crown are compiled on a list called the Indian Register; and such people are called Status Indians. Many non-treaty First Nations and all Inuit and Metis peoples are not subject to the Indian Act. However; two court cases have clarified that Inuit; Metis, and non-status First Nations people, all are covered by the term 'Indians" in the Constitution Act, 1867. The first was Re Eskimos in 1939 covering the Inuit, the second being Daniels v: Canada in 2013 which applies to Metis and non-Status First Nations [25]
Notwithstanding Canada's location within the Americas, the term "Native American" is not used in Canada as it is typically used solely to describe the indigenous peoples within the boundaries of the present-day United States [26]

The characteristics of Canadian Aboriginal culture included permanent settlements [10] agriculture [11] civic and ceremonial architecture [12] complex societal hierarchies and trading networks [13] The Metis culture of mixed blood originated in the mid-17th century when First Nation and Inuit people married Europeans [14] The Inuit had more limited interaction with European settlers during that early period [1 5] Various laws, treaties, and legislation have been enacted between European immigrants and First Nations across Canada. Aboriginal Right to Self-Government provides opportunity to manage historical; cultural, political, health care and economic control aspects within first peoples communities:
As of the 2011 census; Aboriginal peoples in Canada totaled 1,400,685 people, or 4.3% of the national population, spread over 600 recognized First Nations governments or bands with distinctive cultures, languages, art, and music. [T[16] National Aboriginal Day recognizes the cultures and contributions of Aboriginal peoples to the history of Canada [17] First Nations, Inuit and Metis peoples of all backgrounds have become prominent figures and have served as role models in the Aboriginal community and help to shape the Canadian cultural identity-[18]

The terms First Peoples and First Nations are both used to refer to indigenous peoples of Canada [19] The terms First Peoples or Aboriginal peoples in Canada are normally broader terms than First Nations, as they include Inuit; Metis and First Nations. First Nations (most often used in the plural) has come into general use for the indigenous peoples of North America in Canada, and their descendants, who are neither Inuit nor Metis. On reserves, First Nations is being supplanted by members of various nations referring to themselves by their group or ethnical identity: In conversation this would be "I am Haida" , or we are Kwantlens" in recognition of their First Nations ethnicities [20] In this Act; Aboriginal peoples of Canada' includes the Indian, Inuit and Metis peoples of Canada [21] CRCi CHT Onlin ufa Indian remains in place as the legal term used in the Canadian Constitution.

Indigenous peoples in Canada Indigenous peoples in Canada,[2] also known as Indigenous Canadians or Aboriginal Canadians, are the indigenous peoples within the boundaries of present-day Canada. They comprise the First Nations [3] Inuit[4] and Metis. [5] Although "Indian" is a term still commonly used in legal documents, the descriptors "Indian" and 'Eskimo" have somewhat fallen into disuse in Canada and some consider them to be pejorative [6J[7][8] Similarly; "Aboriginal" as a collective noun is a specific term of art used in some legal documents, including the Constitution Act 1982,though in some circles that word is also falling into disfavour [9]
Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are some of the earliest known sites of human habitation in Canada.

Based on the Treaty of Tordesillas, the Spanish Crown claimed It had territorial rights In the area visited by John Cabot in 1497 and 1498 CE [37] However; Portuguese explorers like Joao Fernandes Lavrador would continue to visited the north Atlantic coast, which accounts for the appearance of "Labrador" on topographical maps of the period [38] In 1501 and 1502 the Corte-Real brothers explored Newfoundland (Terra Nova) and Labrador claiming these lands as part of the Portuguese Empire [38][39] In 1506, King Manuel | of Portugal created taxes for the cod fisheries in Newfoundland waters.

Pre-Columbian distribution of Na-Dene languages in North America
The Interior of British Columbia was home to the Salishan language groups such as the Shuswap (Secwepemc) , Okanagan and southern Athabaskan language groups, primarily the Dakelh (Carrier) and the Tsilhqot'in [27] The inlets and valleys of the British Columbia Coast sheltered large, distinctive populations; such as the Haida, Kwakwaka'wakw and Nuu-chah-nulth, sustained by the region's abundant salmon and shellfish [27] These peoples developed complex cultures dependent on the western red cedar that included wooden houses, seagoing whaling and war canoes and elaborately carved potlatch items and totem poles [27]
In the Arctic archipelago, the distinctive Paleo- Eskimos known as Dorset peoples, whose culture has been traced back to around 500 BCE, were replaced by the ancestors of today's Inuit by 1500 CE[28] This transition is supported by archaeological records and Inuit mythology that tells of having driven off the Tuniit or 'first inhabitants' [29] Inuit traditional laws are anthropologically different from Western law: Customary law was non-existent in Inuit society before the introduction of the Canadian legal system [30]

History of Canada
The history of Canada covers the period from the arrival of Paleo-Indians thousands of years ago to the present day: Canada has been inhabited for millennia by distinctive groups of Aboriginal peoples, with distinct trade networks, spiritual beliefs, and styles of social organization. Some of these civilizations had long faded by the time of the first European arrivals and have been discovered through archaeological investigations. Various treaties and laws have been enacted between European settlers and the Aboriginal populations.
Beginning in the late 1Sth century, French and British expeditions explored, and later settled, along the Atlantic Coast: France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America to Britain in 1763 after the Seven Years' War: In 1867,with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces: This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the British Empire, which became official with the Statute of Westminster of 1931 and completed in the Canada Act of 1982, Which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament:

Great Depression
Canada was hard hit by the worldwide Great Depression that began in 1929_ Between 1929 and 1933,the gross national product dropped 40% (compared to 37% in the US) Unemployment reached 27% at the depth of the Depression in 1933.[169] Many businesses closed, as corporate profits of S396 million in 1929 turned into losses of S98 million in 1933. Canadian exports shrank by 50% from 1929 to 1933. Construction all but stopped (down 82%, 1929-33), and wholesale prices dropped 30%_ Wheat prices plunged from 78c per bushel (1928 crop) to 29c in 1932 [169]
Urban unemployment nationwide was 19%; Torontos rate was 17%, according to the census of 1931. Farmers who stayed on their farms were not considered unemployed [170] By 1933, 30% of the labour force was out of work, and one fifth of the population became dependent on government assistance. Wages fell as did prices Worst hit were areas dependent on primary industries such as farming; mining and logging, as prices fell and there were few alternative jobs. Most families had moderate losses and little hardship, though they too became pessimistic and their debts become heavier as prices fell Some families saw most or all of their assets disappear; and suffered severely [171][172]

In 1930,in the first stage of the long depression; Prime Minister Mackenzie King believed that the crisis was a temporary swing of the business cycle and that the economy would soon recover without government intervention He refused to provide unemployment relief or federal aid to the provinces, saying that if Conservative provincial governments demanded federal dollars, he would not give them "a five cent piece "[173] His blunt wisecrack was used to defeat the Liberals in the 1930 election: The main issue was the rapid deterioration in the economy and whether the prime minister was out of touch with the hardships of ordinary people [174][175] The winner of the 1930 election was Richard Bedford Bennett and the Conservatives Bennett had promised high tariffs and large-scale spending; but as deficits increased, he became wary and cut back severely on Federal spending: With falling support and the depression getting only worse; Bennett attempted to introduce policies based on the New Deal of President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) in the United States, but he got little passed. Bennett's government became a focus of popular discontent: For example, auto owners saved on gasoline by using horses to pull their cars, dubbing them Bennett Buggies: The Conservative failure to restore prosperity led to the return of Mackenzie King's Liberals in the 1935 election [176]

The worst of the Depression had passed by 1935,as Ottawa launched relief programs such as the National Housing Act and National Employment Commission. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation became a crown corporation in 1936. Trans-Canada Airlines (the precursor to Air Canada) was formed in 1937,as was the National Film Board of Canada in 1939.

Second World War
Canada's involvement in the Second World War began when Canada declared war on Nazi Germany on September 10, 1939, delaying it one week after Britain acted to symbolically demonstrate independence: The war restored Canada's economic health and its self- confidence as it played a major role in the Atlantic and in Europe. During the war; Canada became more closely linked to the U.S: The ~plinanmiate Americans took virtual control of Yukon in order to build the Alaska Highway, and were a major presence in the British colony of Newfoundland with major airbases [182]

Mackenzie King and Canada were largely ignored by Winston Churchill and the British government despite Canada's major role in supplying food, raw materials, munitions and money to the hard-pressed British economy; training airmen for the Commonwealth, guarding the western half of the North Atlantic Ocean against German U-boats, and providing combat troops for the invasions of Italy, France and Germany in 1943-45. The government successfully mobilized the economy for war; with impressive results in industrial and agricultural output; The depression ended, prosperity returned, and Canada's economy expanded significantly: On the political side, Mackenzie King rejected any notion of a government of national unity [183] The Canadian federal election, 1940 was held as normally scheduled, producing another majority for the Liberals_

After the start of war with Japan in December 1941,the government; in cooperation with the US: 4 began the Japanese-Canadian internment, which sent 22,000 British Columbia residents of OUAC Japanese descent to relocation camps far from the coast: The reason was intense public demand for removal and fears of espionage or sabotage [185] The government ignored reports from the RCMP and Canadian military that most of the Japanese were law-abiding and not a threat [186]

Music
The Aboriginal peoples of Canada encompass diverse ethnic groups with their individual musical tradltions_ Music is usually social (public) or ceremonial (private) . Public, social music may be dance music accompanied by rattles and drums: Private; ceremonial music includes vocal songs with accompaniment on percussion, used to mark occasions like Midewivin ceremonies and Sun Dances.
Traditionally; Aboriginal peoples used the materials at hand t0 make their instruments for centuries before Europearis Immigrated to Canada [156] First Nations people made gourds and animal horns into rattles, which were elaborately carved and brightly palnted [157] In woodland areas, they made horris of birch bark and drumsticks of carved antlers and wood. job  Traditional percussion instruments such as drums were generally made of carved wood and animal hides. These musical instruments provide the background for songs, and songs the background for dances. Traditional First Nations people consider song and dance to be sacred. For years after Europeans came to Canada, First Nations people were forbidden to practice their ceremonies [155][156]

There are three (First Nations [3] Inuit[4] and Metis[S]) distinctive groups of North America indigenous peoples recognized in the Canadlani Coristitution Act, 1982,sections 25 and 35.(21] Under the Employmerit Equity Act; Aboriginal people are a dlesignated group along with women; visible minorities, and persons with disabilities [158] They are not a visible minority under the Employment Equity Act and in the view of Statistics Canada [159] iemiote joh.

Visual art
Indigenous peoples were producing art for thousands of years before the arrival of European settler colonists and the eventual establishment of Carada as a nation state. Like the peoples who produced them; Indigenous art tradltions spanned territories across North America. Indigenous art traditions are organized by art historians according to cultural, linguistic or regional groups: Northwest Coast; Plateau; Plains, Eastern Woodlands, Subarctic, ard Arctic [152]
Art traditions vary enormously amongst and within these diverse groups: Indigenous art with a focus 0n portability and the body is distinguished from European tradilions and its focus on architecture: Indigenous visual art may be used conjunction with other arts. Shamans masks and rattles are used ceremoniously in dance; storytelling and music [152] Artworks preserved in museum collections date from the period after European contact and shaw evidence of the creative adoption and adaptation of European trade goods such as metal and glass beads [153] The distinct Metis cultures that have arisen from inter-cultural relationships with Europeans contribute culturally hybrid art forms [154] During the 19th and the first half of the 20th century the TRCH Canadian governmerit pursued an active policy of forced and cultural assimilation toward jol) indigenous peoples; The Indian Act banned manifestations of the Sun Dance; the Potlatch; and works of arl depicting them [155]
It was nol until the 1950s and 1960s that indigenous artists such as Mungo Martin; Bill Reid and Norval Morrisseau began to publicly renew and re-invent indigenous art traditions. Currently there are indigenous artists practising in all media in Canada and two indigenous arlists; Edward Poitras and Rebecca Belmore; have represented Canada at the Venice Biennale in 1995 and 2005 respectively [152]

Because of laws and policies that encouraged or required Indigenous peoples to assimilate into a Eurocentric society, Canada violated the United Nations Genocide Convention that Canada signed in 1949 and passed through Parliament in 1952 [119] The residential school system that removed Aboriginal children from their homes has led scholars to believe that Canada can be tried in international court for genocide [119] A legal case resulted in settlement of 2 billion CS in 2006 and the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission which confirmed the injurious nt " erota O) effect on children of this system and turmoil created between Aboriginal Canadians and Canadian Society [120] In 2008 Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued an apology on behalf of the Canadian government and its citizens for the residential school system [121]

Of all the initiatives that were undertaken in the first century of Confederation, none was more ambitious or central to the civilizing strategy of the Department; to its goal of assimilation; than the residential school system it was the residential school experience that would lead children most effectively out of their "savage communities into "higher civilization" and "full citizenship "[116]
Beginning in 1847 and lasting until 1996,the Canadian government, in partnership with the Catholic Church, ran 130 residential boarding schools across Canada for Aboriginal children, who were forcibly taken from their homes [117] While the schools were said to educate they were plagued by under-funding; disease, and abuse [118]

Forced assimilation
From the late 18th century, European Canadians (and the Canadian government) encouraged assimilation of Aboriginal culture into what was referred to as "Canadian culture" [1O9][110] These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 2Oth centuries, with a series of initiatives that aimed at complete assimilation and subjugation of the Aboriginal peoples. These policies, which were made possible by legislation such as the Gradual Civilization Act[111] and the Indian Act,[112] focused on European ideals of Christianity, sedentary living; agriculture, and education:
The attempt at Christianization of the Aboriginal people of Canada had been ongoing since the first missionaries arrived in the 1600s,however it became more systematic with the Indian Act in 1876, which would bring new sanctions for those who did not convert to Christianity: For example, the new laws would prevent non- Christian Aboriginal people from testifying or having their cases heard in court and ban alcohol consumption [113] When the Indian Act was amended in 1884, traditional religious and social practices, such as the Potlatch, would be banned, and further amendments in 1920 would prevent 'status Indians" (as defined in the Act) from wearing traditional dress or performing traditional dances in an attempt to stop all non- Christian practices [113]

Another focus of the Canadian government was to make the Aboriginal groups of Canada sedentary, as they thought that this would make them easier to assimilate. In the 19th century, the government began to support the creation of model farming villages, which were meant to encourage non-sedentary Aboriginal groups to settle in an area and begin to cultivate agriculture [114] When most of these model farming villages failed [114] the government turned instead to the creation of Indian reserves with the Indian Act of 1876.[112] With the creation of these reserves came many restricting laws, such as further bans on all intoxicants, restrictions on eligibility to vote in band elections, decreased hunting and fishing areas, and inability for status Indians to visit other groups on their reservations [112]
Through the Gradual Civilization Act in 1857,the government would encourage Indians (i.e,, First Nations) to enfranchise - to remove all legal distinctions between [Indians] and Her Majesty's other Canadian Subjects [111] If an Aboriginal chose to enfranchise; it would strip them and their family of Aboriginal title; with the idea that they would become "less savage" and more civilized' thus become assimilated into Canadian society [1 1 5] However; they were often still defined as non-citizens by Europeans, and those few who did enfranchise were often met with disappointment [115]

It had been a calamity, pure and simple [105] To take the place of the internal fire that was urging Americans westward across the continent, there was only melancholy contemplation of things as they might have been and dingy reflection of that ineffably glorious world across the stormy Atlantic  English Canada started its life with as powerful a nostalgic shove backward into the past as the Conquest had given to French Canada; two little peoples officially devoted to counter-revolution, to lost causes, to the tawdry ideals of a society of men and masters, and not to the self-reliant freedom alongside of them [105]

Rebellions and the Durham Report
The rebellions of 1837 against the British colonial government took place in both Upper and Lower Canada. In Upper Canada,a band of Reformers under the leadership of William Lyon Mackenzie took up arms in a disorganized and ultimately unsuccessful series of small-scale skirmishes around Toronto, London, and Hamilton [110]
In Lower Canada, a more substantial rebellion occurred against British rule. Both English- and French-Canadian rebels, sometimes using bases in the neutral United States, fought several skirmishes against the authorities. The towns of Chambly and Sorel were taken by the rebels, and reIU (p) Quebec City was isolated from the rest of the colony: Montreal rebel leader Robert Nelson read the "Declaration of Independence of Lower Canada' to a crowd assembled at the town of Napierville in 1838 [111] The rebellion of the Patriote movement was defeated after battles across Quebec Hundreds were arrested, and several villages were burnt in reprisal [111]

British Government then sent Lord Durham to examine the situation; he stayed in Canada only five months before returning to Britain and brought with him his Durham Report, which strongly recommended responsible government [112] A less well-received recommendation was the amalgamation of Upper and Lower Canada for the deliberate assimilation of the French- speaking population. The Canadas were merged into a single colony; the United Province of Canada, by the 1840 Act of Union, and responsible government was achieved in 1848, a few months after it was accomplished in Nova Scotia [112] The parliament of United Canada in Montreal was set on fire by a mob of Tories in 1849 after the passing of an indemnity bill for the people who suffered losses during the rebellion in Lower Canada [113]

The Irish Famine of the 1840s significantly increased the pace of Irish Catholic immigration to British North America, with over 35,000 distressed Irish landing in Toronto alone in 1847 and 1848.[115]

Women's political status without the vote was vigorously promoted by the National Council of Women of Canada from 1894to 1918. It promoted a vision of "transcendent citizenship" for women. The ballot was not needed, for citizenship was to be exercised through personal influence and moral suasion, through the election of men with strong moral character; and through raising public-spirited sons [153] The National Council position reflected its nation-building program that sought to uphold Canada as a White settler nation. While the woman suffrage movement was important for extending the political rights of White women, it was also authorized through race-based arguments that linked White women's enfranchisement to the need to protect the nation from 'racial degeneration "[153] Untine remote ob"` Women did have a local vote in some provinces, as in Canada West from 1850,where women owning land could vote for school trustees. By 1900 other provinces adopted similar provisions, and in 1916 Manitoba took the lead in extending full woman's suffrage [154] Simultaneously suffragists gave strong support to the prohibition movement; especially in Ontario and the Western provinces [155][156]

As a result of its contribution to Allied victory in the First World War; Canada became more assertive and less deferential to British authority. Convinced that Canada had proven itself on the battlefields of Europe; Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden demanded that it have a separate seat at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. This was initially opposed not only by Britain but also by the United States, which saw such a delegation as an extra British vote. Borden responded by pointing out that since Canada had lost nearly 60,000 men, a far larger proportion of its men, its right to equal status as a nation had been consecrated on the battlefield. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George eventually relented, and convinced the reluctant Americans to accept the presence of delegations from Canada, India, Australia, Newfoundland, New Zealand, and South Africa, These also received their own seats in the League of Nations [158] Canada asked for neither reparations nor mandates. It played only a modest role at Paris, but just having a seat was a matter of pride. It was cautiously optimistic about the new League of Nations, in which it played an active and independent role.

In 1921 to 1926, William Lyon Mackenzie King's Liberal government pursued a conservative domestic policy with the object of lowering wartime taxes and, especially, cooling wartime ethnic tensions, as well as defusing postwar labour conflicts. The Progressives refused to join the government, but did help the Liberals defeat non-confidence motions: King faced a delicate balancing act of reducing tariffs enough to please the Prairie-based Progressives, but not too much to alienate his vital support in industrial Ontario and Quebec, which needed tariffs to compete with American imports. King and Conservative leader Arthur Meighen sparred constantly and bitterly in Commons debates [165] The Progressives gradually weakened. Their effective and passionate leader; Thomas Crerar; resigned to return to his grain business, and was replaced by the more placid Robert Forke. The socialist reformer JS Woodsworth gradually gained influence and power among the Progressives, and he reached an accommodation with King on policy matters.

Champlain's Quebec City habitation c. 1608
In 1608 Champlain founded what is now Quebec City, one of the earliest permanent settlements, which would become the capital of New France. [52] He took personal administration over the city and its affairs, and sent out expeditions to explore the interior [53] Champlain himself discovered Lake Champlain in 1609.By 1615,he had travelled by canoe up the Ottawa River through Lake Nipissing and Georgian Bay to the centre of Huron country near Lake Simcoe [54] During these voyages, Champlain aided the Wendat (aka 'Hurons') in their battles against the Iroquois Confederacy [55] As a result; the Iroquois would become enemies of the French and be involved in multiple conflicts (known as the French and Iroquois Wars) until the signing of the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701.[56]

In 1604,a North American fur trade monopoly was granted to Pierre Du Gua, Sieur de Mons: [49] The fur trade became one of the main economic ventures in North America [50] Du Gua led his first colonization expedition to an island located near the mouth of the St. Croix River: Among his lieutenants was a geographer named Samuel de Champlain, who promptly carried out a major exploration of the northeastern coastline of what is now the United States [49] In the spring of 1605,under Samuel de Champlain; the new St. Croix settlement was moved to Port Royal (today's Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia) [51]

Although immigration rates to New France remained very low under direct French control, [68] most of the new arrivals were farmers, and the rate of population growth among the settlers themselves had been very high [69] The women had about 30 per cent more children than comparable women who remained in France: [70] Yves Landry says; "Canadians had an exceptional diet for their time "[70] This was due to the natural abundance of meat, fish, and pure water; the good food conservation conditions during the winter; and an adequate wheat supply in most years [70] The 1666 census of New France was conducted by France's intendant, Jean Talon; in the winter of 1665-1666. The census showed a population count of 3,215 Acadians and habitants (French-Canadian farmers) in the administrative districts of Acadia and Canada [71] The census also revealed a great difference in the number of men at 2,034 versus 1,181 women [72]

After Champlains death in 1635,the Roman Catholic Church and the Jesuit establishment became the most dominant force in New France neeremate jon and hoped to establish a utopian European and Aboriginal Christian community [65] In 1642,the Sulpicians sponsored a group of settlers led by Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve; who founded Ville-Marie, precursor to present-day Montreal.

By the early 1700s the New France settlers were well established along the shores of the Saint Lawrence River and parts of Nova Scotia, with a population around 16,000.[73] However new arrivals stopped coming from France in the proceeding decades,[74][75][76] resulting in the English and Scottish settlers in Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and the southern Thirteen Colonies to vastly outnumber the French population approximately ten to one by the 1750s.[68][77] From 1670,through the Hudson's Bay Company; the English also laid claim to Hudson Bay and its drainage basin known as Rupert's Land establishing new trading posts and forts, while continuing to operate fishing settlements in Newfoundland [78] French expansion along the Canadian canoe routes challenged the Hudson's Bay Company claims, and in 1686,Pierre Troyes led an overland expedition from Montreal to the shore of the bay; where they managed to capture a handful of outposts [79] La Salles explorations gave France a claim to the Mississippi River Valley; where fur trappers and a few settlers set up scattered forts and settlements [80]

Louisbourg was intended to serve as a year- round military and naval base for France's remaining North American empire and to protect the entrance to the St. Lawrence River. Father Rale's War resulted in both the fall of New France influence in present-day Maine and the British recognition of having to negotiate with the Mi'kmaq in Nova Scotia. During King George's War (1744 to 1748), an army of New Englanders led by William Pepperrell mounted an expedition of 90 vessels and 4,000 men against Louisbourg in 1745.[86] Within three months the fortress surrendered_ The return of Louisbourg to French control by the peace treaty prompted the British to found Halifax in 1749 under Edward Cornwallis [87] Despite the official cessation of war between the British and French empires with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle; the conflict in Acadia and Nova Scotia continued on as the Father Le Loutre's War [88]

There were four French and Indian Wars and two additional wars in Acadia and Nova Scotia between the Thirteen American Colonies and New France from 1688 to 1763. During King William's War (1688 to 1697), military conflicts in Acadia included: Battle of Port Royal (1690); a naval battle in the Bay of Fundy (Action of July 14,1696); and the Raid on Chignecto (1696) [81] The Treaty of Ryswick in 1697 ended the war between the two colonial powers of England and France for a brief time [82] During Queen Anne's War (1702 to 1713),the British Conquest of Acadia occurred in 1710,[83] resulting in Nova Scotia, other than Cape Breton, being officially (T (m Ot ToD) ceded to the British by the Treaty of Utrecht including Rupert's Land, which France had conquered in the late 17th century (Battle of Hudson's Bay) [84] As an immediate result of this setback, France founded the powerful Fortress of Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island [85]
